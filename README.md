# Unity ROS

This is the new and improved Unity ROS2 repository. You need to install ROS2 Galactic for this. Why Galactic? Most of our robots run Jetson Nano's which I only could get Ubuntu 20.04 on, which limits us to that.

## To run

Run the launch file in arm\_rl, which should really be in it's own thing... oh well.
